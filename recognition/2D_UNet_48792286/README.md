## Project Overview
### The objective of this project is to segment prostate cancer lesions (https://doi.org/10.25919/45t8-p065) using a 2D UNet model. Accurate segmentation of these lesions is crucial for diagnosing and treating prostate cancer effectively. The goal is to achieve a minimum Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.75 on the test set for the prostate label.The project utilizes processed 2D slices in Nifti file format to train and evaluate the segmentation model.
